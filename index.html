                    The Celsius°Cooking™ system puts fine-tuned, technical control in
                    the palm of your hand – literally. Now you have the power to change,
                    define, and monitor the temperatures and timings of the food you
                    cook with a new level of precision. And with the connected pan, hob,
                    and probe, the enjoyably hands-on experience of working on the hob
                    becomes a finely-tuned culinary adventure. Celsius°Cooking™
                    equipment links directly to the companion app from Hestan Cue that
                    not only allows you to set, control, and monitor temperatures and
                    timings but which is also home to a large collection of
                    inspirational step-by-step recipes. Not only will this inspire you
                    to make something delicious, but it’s also the best way to learn how
                    to use the Celsius°Cooking™ system: by getting your hands on it and
                    seeing what it can really do

                Celsius°Cooking™ measures temperatures at the bottom of the connected
                pots and pans – both when frying, and when simmering delicate sauces
                that can easily catch or burn – and through a probe that can be put
                directly into the food. It is a sophisticated piece of technology that
                lets you measure your foods temperature very precisely
